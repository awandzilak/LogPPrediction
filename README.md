## Prediction of octanol-water partition coefficient of small drug-like molecules based on topological descriptors

### Background
Organic solvents - water partition coefficients are amongst the most meaningful molecular properties in drug design.  An easy access to partition coefficient is therefore instrumental. Unfortunately, systematic measurement of partition coefficient is often prohibitive due to time and resource constraints. To circumvent these constraints, systematic fast and accurate prediction of the partition coefficients is a highly desirable goal. 

### Goal
The purpose of this project is to employ different machine learning methods, such as: **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest** and **Neural Network** to **predict** the value of octanol-water partition coefficient (**logP**) based on a restricted number of topological descriptors. The models will be also compared.
