    "#### Scraping the data from ZINC20 database https://zinc20.docking.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "All data in this project are coming from a free ZINC20 database. The goal is be to predict logP value based on various, mostly topological, descriptors. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this study some of the descriptors were taken directly from ZINC20 molecule pages (example: https://zinc15.docking.org/substances/ZINC000000057058/). These included molecular weight, number of rings, heavy and hetero atoms and the fraction of sp3 hybridized carbon atoms.  Furthermore, for some molecules, additional parameters measured at different pH levels (6.4, 7.0, 7.4, 8.4) were available. Those included: net charge, number of H-bond donors, H-bond acceptors and rotatable bonds, tPSA and apolar and polar desolvation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simultaneously, based on SMILES *(Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification)*, which represent the moleculesâ€™ structure, with the use of RDKit library additional parameters were obtained. Majority of them were parameters available also from the ZINC database, generated just for the purpose of verification."
